This folder has just my Jupyter notebooks that I've done recently to refresh the methods and techniques 
I've learned in my data science and machine learning class during my undergraduate.
Some of these notebooks will have code or libraries I choose to learn after my classes, such accessing 
MySQL databases or using OpenCV in Python for image data processing. I will definitely update this folder 
as I learn new ideas and tools or re-do some work to refresh my memory on how to code some methods/approaches.
